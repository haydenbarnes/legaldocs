# legaldocs
A collection of routine legal forms I have released from my Georgia legal practice.
The forms are provided in plain text format so they may be used by any word processing software.

These documents are provided for free "as-is" with no warranty of any kind, express or implied.
Reliance upon any of these documents does not form an attorney-client relationship.

Pursuant to the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 4.3 unrepresented persons are advised to consult competent legal counsel in their respective jurisdictions.

No claim to original government works.
