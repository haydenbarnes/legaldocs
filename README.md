# legaldocs
A collection of routine legal forms I have released from my Georgia legal practice in plain text format.

These documents are provided for free "as-is" with no warranty of any kind, express or implied.
Reliance upon any of these documents does not form an attorney-client relationship.

Pursuant to the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 4.3 unrepresented persons are advised to consult competent legal counsel in their respective jurisdictions.
